AI-Based Resume Screener – A tool that scores resumes based on job descriptions using NLP.
An AI-Based Resume Screener is a powerful tool that automates the process of evaluating resumes against job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Here's the structure of this project:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Overview
Develop a system that automatically scores and ranks resumes based on how well they match a given job description. The tool should extract key skills, experience, education, and other relevant details from both resumes and job descriptions and provide a similarity score.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features
Resume Parsing – Extracts relevant information (name, skills, experience, education) from resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
Job Description Analysis – Extracts required qualifications, skills, and job responsibilities.
Skill Matching & Scoring – Compares extracted resume skills with job requirements using NLP.
Ranking System – Assigns a similarity score (e.g., 0-100) based on relevance.
Keyword & Synonym Matching – Uses NLP techniques (word embeddings, TF-IDF) to handle different terminology.
Bias Detection & Fairness – Flags potential biases (e.g., gender-neutral language suggestions).
ATS Integration (Optional) – Can integrate with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
Web Dashboard (Optional) – A simple UI where recruiters upload resumes and view results.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology Stack
Backend & AI Components
Python – Core development language
SpaCy / NLTK – NLP for text analysis
TF-IDF / BERT / OpenAI GPT – Text similarity and ranking
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models for classification
Flask / FastAPI – API backend

Frontend (Optional)
React / Angular / Vue – UI for recruiters to upload resumes
TailwindCSS / Bootstrap – Styling

Database & Storage
PostgreSQL / MongoDB – Stores resumes and job descriptions
Elasticsearch – For fast searching and indexing

Cloud & Deployment
AWS S3 / Firebase Storage – Store resumes
Docker & Kubernetes – Containerization
CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) – Automated deployment

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation Steps
Resume Parsing Module

Use PyMuPDF (for PDF parsing), python-docx (for DOCX), or Tika.
Extract skills, experience, education, etc.
Job Description Processing

Tokenization and POS tagging to identify key requirements.
Use TF-IDF, word embeddings, or BERT to vectorize descriptions.
Scoring Mechanism

Use Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Similarity, or BERT embeddings.
Assign weights (e.g., higher weight for skills, lower for education).
Web Interface (Optional)

Create a Flask API to serve resume scores.
Build a simple React UI for uploading resumes and viewing rankings.
Testing & Refinement

Test with real-world resumes and job descriptions.
Improve performance with feedback and tuning.

Future Enhancements
Chatbot Integration – AI assistant to help recruiters refine job descriptions.
Bias Detection – Highlight potentially biased words in descriptions.
Multilingual Support – Process resumes in different languages
LinkedIn Integration – Auto-fetch candidate profiles
